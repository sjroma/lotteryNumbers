# Generate random numbers for the Mega Millions and Powerball lotteries  

## Click to go to my [Generate Lotter Numbers website]()  

A front-end Javascript exercise to generate random numbers for the U.S. based
lottery games, Mega Millions and Powerball.  

* in HTML it was a good way for me to brush up on when to use `id=` and `class=`  
* the CSS portion, while simple, was still a good exercise in setting up something that 
was easy to look at yet also functional  
* Javascript was a bit of a challange. I struggled on whether to generate the numbers 
using the `Math` function or selecting them from an array of numbers.  
  * If using an array of numbers should I randomize the array and select the first set...  
  * Should I randomize the array and then use the `Math` function to select numbers from
  the array..
  * ultimately I decided to just generate random numbers using the `Math` function
