# Generate random numbers for the _Mega Millions_ and _Powerball_ lotteries  

## Click to <a href="https://sjroma.github.io/lotterynumbers" target="_blank">generate your lottery numbers</a>  

A front-end JavaScript exercise to generate random numbers for the U.S. based
lottery games, [_Mega Millions_](https://www.megamillions.com) and [_Powerball_](https://www.megamillions.com).  

* the HTML portion was a good way for me to brush up on when to use `id=` and when to use `class=`  
* the CSS portion, while simple, was still a good exercise in setting up something that 
was simple and pleasing to look at and also functional  
* Javascript was a bit of a challange. I struggled on whether to  
  * generate the numbers using the `Math` object or select them from an array of numbers  
    * if an array, should I just use the `Math` object to select numbers from the array?
    * if an array, should I randomize the array and select the first set?  
    * should I randomize the array and then use the `Math` object to select numbers from the array?  
  * ultimately I decided to generate random numbers using the `Math` object
