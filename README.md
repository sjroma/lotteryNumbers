# Generate random numbers for the Mega Millions and Powerball lotteries  

## Click to go to my [Generate Lottery Numbers website](https://sjroma.github.io/lotteryNumbers)  

A front-end Javascript exercise to generate random numbers for the U.S. based
lottery games, [Mega Millions](https://www.megamillions.com) and [Powerball](https://www.megamillions.com).  

* in HTML this was a good way for me to brush up on when to use `id=` and `class=`  
* the CSS portion, while simple, was still a good exercise in setting up something that 
was easy and pleasing to look at yet, also functional  
* Javascript was a bit of a challange. I struggled on whether to  
  * generate the numbers using the `Math` function or selecting them from an array of numbers   
  * if using an array of numbers should I randomize the array and select the first set...  
  * should I randomize the array and then use the `Math` function to select numbers from
  the array..  
  * ultimately I decided to just generate random numbers using the `Math` function
